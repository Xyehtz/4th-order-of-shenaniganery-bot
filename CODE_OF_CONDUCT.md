## Rules

All the rules in this document are related to the way the member of the club uses the bot inside of the Discord server, specifically regarding the use of AI with the !askDoof command

### 1. !askDoof must not be used in order to do assignment, quizzes, tests, exercises, etc.

The use of the !askDoof command must be in order to have fun in the club, and to do "silly" things that do not put yourself in an unfair advantage against other students.

The use of AI in order to obtain this type of advantage is prohibited in the club, failure to do so will make the moderation team of the club set a penalization to the member of the club.
