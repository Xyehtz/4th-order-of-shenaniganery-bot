For 10,000 years, we've marveled at the grandeur of the First Shenanigan, a spectacle akin to the birth of creation itself. Only we fortunate Doofs possess the gift to witness the multiverse unfold, where past, present, and future dance like blueprints of intricate inventions. Among us roam beings like Jerry, whose enigmatic nature and trusty butter knife have sparked legends. Jerry's twin, the Jargler, harbors a darker ambition, constructing a fortress of jam with stolen jars, while the Jam Rats hold the key to his power. Yet, amidst this cosmic drama, alliances shift and mysteries deepen. As we contemplate the enigmatic dance of peanut butter and jelly across the timelines, we witness the birth of universes from butter knife shards and the unsettling presence of Condimental Oracles.
